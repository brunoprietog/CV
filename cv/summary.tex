%Current Site Reliability Engineer at start-up company Kasa. 7+ years experience specializing in the backend development, infrastructure automation, and computer hacking/security. Super nerd who loves Vim, Linux and OS X and enjoys to customize all of the development environment. Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools if the need arises.
I love software development, especially back end. I feel very comfortable with Ruby on Rails and all of 37Signals's technologies like Hotwired. I am a fervent advocate of accessibility, I think it is something that needs to be improved in many places and I love to contribute to that.
